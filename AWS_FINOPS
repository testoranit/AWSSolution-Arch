CLoud Pricing concepts

Pay for what u consume
no capex is required
use opex mode pay as u use
every sevice has different pricing model.
benefits:-
1)pay for what u use.
2)Pay as u go:- no long term contracts:- when u stop using resources we stop paying for it.
3)Use more and pay les:- tiered pricing for many serviverics ,more data u store pay less storage s3
4)Commit and Pay less:- u have an opportunity to make a commitment and get a discount in return
eg:- saving plans or reservations
5)Optimized:_ scale up and down.
6)No complex licesing:-

Pricing modesl:- 1)On demand;_ pay for services as u use them.
2)Commitment model:_ making a financinl commitment in return for discount like savings plans and reservations
3)Spot instances:_ no commitments, less reliable. but
4)Free tier:_ at no cost to explore aws services


3) Funda drives costs
1)Paying for compute
2)STorage :_ per  geegabiyte usage
3)Data  transfer:_ data going out of cloud.

Pricing factors
1)Resource usage2)TIme 3)Service level:_ support and redundancy which is required 4)

Service models:-
1)IaaS:_ rent vm's storae and networks
2)Paas:- gets platforms so that u can develop, no in fra access
3)SaaS:_ user subscribe to access software that are ready to use.


Principles for on-prem IT for overspending vs cloud
ON prem              vs cloud
capex(fixed costs)                   opex
Maninatinence and upgrades       provider handles(can reduce operation issues sometimes)
Saclability and Elasticity         dynamic scaling
software licesing has long term   BYOL
commitment
Power cooling costs,reasl estate  indirect sosts are included in pricing.
costs lead to indeirect sosts
asset deprciaition                cloud handles asset depriciation
								 MOnitor cosots
Vm's can be optimized hardware isn't cloud:- both can be done.


Free tier:-
Some services are always free:- Dynamo db offers 25gb of storage.
2)12 months free
3)short term trials:-  Amazon redshift 750 hrs free for 2 months.
check AWS documentation.


how to use:-
1)expolre and learn.
2)early stage startups.
3)samll projects

Best practice
1)Monitoring
2)Account age
3)Multiple services(EC2 would be free associated data tranfer not.

regulary cleanup unused resources.
*********************Pricing research
AWS Pricing-->pricing-->On demand-->Calculator


Savings plans
Longer commitment lock in period(use it or loose it), if u pay early then higher discount.
Ec2,RDS,lamdba,fargate,redshift,dynamodb

3 types
1)compute savings plan :_ for all above servicees,Disocunt up to 66% applies to any instance type.
2)Ec2 Instance savings plan:- disocunt upto 72%, ony for ec2 u need to commit to specific family & region like m5 but size could vary.
3)amazon sagemaker:_ discount upto 64%, any sagemaker instance.

*************Reserved Instances
sope is regional or zonal

zonal

Billing discount of 72%, locked into AZ,instance family and size
