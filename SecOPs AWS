**AWS COnfig(Detective controls)
Inventry and COnfig mgmt serive from AWS,it helps to find out near real time inventory of all the resources that is running in you account.
u can aggrgate all ur config details into one dashboard, and then u can find out how many resources are ruuning in ur account.
It is not a point in time data u can also see and find what was the configuration previously on particular resources.So u can naviagate and find ot what changes have happened.

It also helps to ientify if u a re using best practices or not.if ur complying to secutiry standars like HIPAA and PCI.
It also helps in doing auto remediation of certain controls by using dashboards or writing some custom rules and custom lambda finctions. in case of non-compliance.


**How AWS config works

ur resoeces in AWS-->u enable aws config-->normalised using AWS rules-->1)Notifications 2)API access 3)History snapsots.

go to AWS config- in console and do the configuration for reauired resources .

launch ec2, open port 22 for ssh to all world.
add uncrypted ebs volumes to these ec2.

then config rules.
+ rule-->AWS managed role-->encrypted volumes rules select-->scope resources-->give KMS id of the encrypted volumes
+ rule-->ebs volume attached or not
+ rule-->security group , to check if all traffic is allowed.


now check resourcce inventory in aws config
resource timeline.

You can also used te Advanced Query feature where you can wrie sql queries to identify resources which are compliant or not.

***AWS config aggregators
if u have more then 1 account , and u want to check compliancy accross multiple accounts and it's resources then use aggrgators.
