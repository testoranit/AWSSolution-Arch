**AWS COnfig(Detective controls)
Inventry and COnfig mgmt serive from AWS,it helps to find out near real time inventory of all the resources that is running in you account.
u can aggrgate all ur config details into one dashboard, and then u can find out how many resources are ruuning in ur account.
It is not a point in time data u can also see and find what was the configuration previously on particular resources.So u can naviagate and find ot what changes have happened.

It also helps to ientify if u a re using best practices or not.if ur complying to secutiry standars like HIPAA and PCI.
It also helps in doing auto remediation of certain controls by using dashboards or writing some custom rules and custom lambda finctions. in case of non-compliance.


**How AWS config works

ur resoeces in AWS-->u enable aws config-->normalised using AWS rules-->1)Notifications 2)API access 3)History snapsots.

go to AWS config- in console and do the configuration for reauired resources .

launch ec2, open port 22 for ssh to all world.
add uncrypted ebs volumes to these ec2.

then config rules.
+ rule-->AWS managed role-->encrypted volumes rules select-->scope resources-->give KMS id of the encrypted volumes
+ rule-->ebs volume attached or not
+ rule-->security group , to check if all traffic is allowed.


now check resourcce inventory in aws config
resource timeline.

You can also used te Advanced Query feature where you can wrie sql queries to identify resources which are compliant or not.

***AWS config aggregators
if u have more then 1 account , and u want to check compliancy accross multiple accounts and it's resources then use aggrgators.



***********************************************************
Reactive controls(Auto remediate non-cpmpliant resources using AWS config)
click on remediate button ..it gives some action like role to perform remedial actions this is manual.
for auto remediatal u can use lambda or create a aws cloudformation stack with this auto remediaal faeture.


Aws Enforce No Public Ip's for Ec2 Policy using AWS Config.


Most commmon AWS config rules:-
1)IAM-password-policy
2)Ima-user-groups:- let's say u don't want empty groups in ur account.
3)restricted ssh:- whether sg are having internet access.
4)access-keys-rotated.
5)s3-account-level-public access.
6)eip-attahed:- eip associated with ec2 or not.
7)ebs-volumes_enrcypted


You can create custom roles:-
1)Aws config;;- config rules-:- lamdba function(will evaluate) if IAM role is used in last 3o days or not evalutes everyting and puts back(compliant/non-compliant in config).


*************************************Proactive Security controls.

1)Automatically remediate AWS cloudtrail disabling:- Monitor,alert,re-enable
CLoudtrail is import from auditing pesrepective, if some one is doing malicious acitivyt then they disbae the cloudtrail.
so u should have mechanism to re-enable it( for this lab enable GuardDuty nd Security Hub)
AWScloudtrail is disabled-->this is captured as an event in cloudwatch-->which will trigger an email via sns topic and will also invoke a lambda function which will re-enable the cloudtrail.
****
remove unused security group using lambda which are not in use for a longer time
***********
Proactively monitor and fix bad or overly permissive S3 ACL's
lab:-if someone is adding an object to bucket as public.
so u enable cloudtrail(so that s3 api calls are logged) and put oject ebvent is captured and sent to event brige  and event brige then invokes a step function.
where the step function can notify secops team and u can mention action to remediate the action from public to private.


******Proactively monitor to failed ssh login to ec2
add cloudwatch agent in ec2 and ask the agent to watch ssh logs for that instance.
and ask agent to send all info to cloud watch logs(u can setup some custom metrics) and based on these metrics u can trigger a lamdba function which will triger step function
which will send a notification and isolate the instance.


**********Automatically rotate Ec2 SSH keys for all your instances relaibly.
LAb:- if u have ssh pem keys that are used longer u can roate them using AWS Systems Manager.
orereq:- SSM agent needs to be installed, and an IAM role needs to be created for SSM agent to write the contents to EC2 instance.

Once the above is done.
create a new pem file using ssh-keygen command and copy the content go to AWS systms manager-->run command and add command to add it in ec2_user/home/ssh/auth_keys
choose the number of instances.
and you can do this on all ur instances.

**********Proactively block s3 Public Access at scale.
**Attribute based-access control :- proactively restrict s3 acces based on user tags.
**Attribute based access control:- Proactively restrict access to ec2 based on tags.

learn how to ctreate a fine grained permissions like a pro:_ tools AWS Policy generator and IAM Policy SImulator.

USe AWS Secrets manager to secure ur db credentials and retreive using AWS lamda

![RDS cred](https://github.com/testoranit/AWSSolution-Arch/assets/124513439/c5ce255f-a4fe-4032-914f-19b68a006d55)

**************
USe outbound VPC proxy for domain whitelisting and content filtering.(instead of NAT gateway if requiered)

***
Use IAM Access analyzer to identify unitented resource access.

****************************
Automatically respond to DDos Attacks(intention to bring ur app down, by sql injectstion or multiple request to ur app) using WAF.
for this lab u can use amazon API which they gave it same sample pet api
create WAF, with custom rule(rate limit) let' say if ur application gets 20000 requests for 5 mins deny the app requst.
use an ec2 machine to simulate and attack. so install apache workbench
and hit the api 
after 5 mins u get access forbidden error.

***************
Detect Ec2 instance cred abuse.
Basically some ec2 instance may have an IAM role attached to it to read data from s3, in some casses thr IAM role attached to ec2 may
have access to read all s3 buckets instead of 1 bucket, so if the ec2 server is compromised then the hacker can get access to all s3 buckets.
so attach IAM role with needed prvivliges.

************Automatically respond to ec2 instance cred abuse.
do lab.
